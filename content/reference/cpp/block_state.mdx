### <code className="doc-symbol doc-symbol-function"/> getBlock [#getBlock]

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<Block> getBlock() const
```

Gets the block represented by this block state.





**Returns:**

the block represented by this block state 





        
### <code className="doc-symbol doc-symbol-function"/> getData [#getData]

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<BlockData> getData() const
```

Gets the data for this block state.





**Returns:**

block specific data 





        
### <code className="doc-symbol doc-symbol-function"/> getDimension [#getDimension]

```cpp
Dimension &getDimension() const
```

Gets the dimension which contains the block represented by this block state.





**Returns:**

the dimension containing the block represented by this block state 





        
### <code className="doc-symbol doc-symbol-function"/> getLocation [#getLocation]

```cpp
Location getLocation() const
```

Gets the location of this block state.





**Returns:**

the location 





        
### <code className="doc-symbol doc-symbol-function"/> getType [#getType]

```cpp
std::string getType() const
```

Gets the type of this block state.





**Returns:**

block type 





        
### <code className="doc-symbol doc-symbol-function"/> getX [#getX]

```cpp
int getX() const
```

Gets the x-coordinate of this block state.





**Returns:**

x-coordinate 





        
### <code className="doc-symbol doc-symbol-function"/> getY [#getY]

```cpp
int getY() const
```

Gets the y-coordinate of this block state.





**Returns:**

y-coordinate 





        
### <code className="doc-symbol doc-symbol-function"/> getZ [#getZ]

```cpp
int getZ() const
```

Gets the z-coordinate of this block state.





**Returns:**

z-coordinate 





        
### <code className="doc-symbol doc-symbol-function"/> setData [#setData]

```cpp
Result<void> setData(const BlockData &data)
```

Sets the data for this block state.





**Parameters:**


* `data` New block specific data 




        
### <code className="doc-symbol doc-symbol-function"/> setType [#setType]

```cpp
Result<void> setType(std::string type)
```

Sets the type of this block state.





**Parameters:**


* `type` [**Block**](classendstone_1_1_block.md) type to change this block state to 




        
### <code className="doc-symbol doc-symbol-function"/> update [#update]



```cpp
bool update()
```

Attempts to update the block represented by this state, setting it to yhe new values as defined by this state.



This has the same effect as calling update(false). That is to say, this will not modify the state of a block if it is no longer the same type as it was when this state was taken. It will return false in this eventuality.




**Returns:**

true if the update was successful, otherwise false 





        

```cpp
bool update(bool force)
```

Attempts to update the block represented by this state, setting it to the new values as defined by this state.



This has the same effect as calling update(force, true). That is to say, this will trigger a physics update to surrounding blocks.




**Parameters:**


* `force` true to forcefully set the state 



**Returns:**

true if the update was successful, otherwise false 





        

```cpp
bool update(bool force, bool apply_physics)
```

Attempts to update the block represented by this state, setting it to the new values as defined by this state.



Unless force is true, this will not modify the state of a block if it is no longer the same type as it was when this state was taken. It will return false in this eventuality. 


If force is true, it will set the type of the block to match the new state, set the state data and then return true. 


If apply\_physics is true, it will trigger a physics update on surrounding blocks which could cause them to update or disappear.




**Parameters:**


* `force` true to forcefully set the state 
* `apply_physics` false to cancel updating physics on surrounding blocks 



**Returns:**

true if the update was successful, otherwise false
