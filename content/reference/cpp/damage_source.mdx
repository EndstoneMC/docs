### <code className="doc-symbol doc-symbol-function"/> getActor [#getActor]

```cpp
virtual Actor * endstone::DamageSource::getActor () const = 0
```

Get the actor that caused the damage to occur.



Not to be confused with [**DamageSource::getDamagingActor()**](classendstone_1_1_damage_source.md#function-getdamagingactor), the returned actor is the actor to which the damage is ultimately attributed if the receiver is killed. If, for example, the receiver was damaged by a projectile, the shooter/thrower would be returned.




**Returns:**

an [**Actor**](classendstone_1_1_actor.md) or null 





        
### <code className="doc-symbol doc-symbol-function"/> getDamagingActor [#getDamagingActor]

```cpp
virtual Actor * endstone::DamageSource::getDamagingActor () const = 0
```

Get the actor that directly caused the damage.



Not to be confused with [**DamageSource::getActor()**](classendstone_1_1_damage_source.md#function-getactor), the returned actor is the actor that actually inflicted the damage. If, for example, the receiver was damaged by a projectile, the projectile would be returned.




**Returns:**

an [**Actor**](classendstone_1_1_actor.md) or null 





        
### <code className="doc-symbol doc-symbol-function"/> getType [#getType]

```cpp
virtual std::string_view endstone::DamageSource::getType () const = 0
```

Get the damage type.





**Returns:**

the damage type 





        
### <code className="doc-symbol doc-symbol-function"/> isIndirect [#isIndirect]

```cpp
virtual bool endstone::DamageSource::isIndirect () const = 0
```

Get if this damage is indirect.



Damage is considered indirect if [**DamageSource::getActor()**](classendstone_1_1_damage_source.md#function-getactor) is not equal to [**DamageSource::getDamagingActor()**](classendstone_1_1_damage_source.md#function-getdamagingactor). This will be the case, for example, if a skeleton shot an arrow or a player threw a potion.




**Returns:**

true if is indirect, false otherwise.
