## endstone.block [#endstone.block]

**Classes:**

- [**Block**](#endstone.block.Block) – Represents a block.
- [**BlockData**](#endstone.block.BlockData) – Represents the data related to a live block
- [**BlockFace**](#endstone.block.BlockFace) –
- [**BlockState**](#endstone.block.BlockState) – Represents a captured state of a block, which will not update automatically.

### Block [#endstone.block.Block]

Represents a block.

**Methods:**

- [**capture_state**](#endstone.block.Block.capture_state) – Captures the current state of this block. The returned object will never be updated, and you are not guaranteed that (for example) a sign is still a sign after you capture its state.
- [**set_data**](#endstone.block.Block.set_data) – Sets the complete data for this block
- [**set_type**](#endstone.block.Block.set_type) – Sets the type of this block

**Attributes:**

- [**data**](#endstone.block.Block.data) (<code>[BlockData](#endstone._internal.endstone_python.BlockData)</code>) – Gets the complete data for this block
- [**dimension**](#endstone.block.Block.dimension) (<code>[Dimension](#endstone._internal.endstone_python.Dimension)</code>) – Gets the dimension which contains this Block
- [**location**](#endstone.block.Block.location) (<code>[Location](#endstone._internal.endstone_python.Location)</code>) – Gets the Location of the block
- [**type**](#endstone.block.Block.type) (<code>[str](#str)</code>) – Gets or sets the type of the block.
- [**x**](#endstone.block.Block.x) (<code>[int](#int)</code>) – Gets the x-coordinate of this block
- [**y**](#endstone.block.Block.y) (<code>[int](#int)</code>) – Gets the y-coordinate of this block
