# First Steps

This page helps you:
1. start Endstone for the first time,
2. make a few essential configuration changes, and
3. join from a Bedrock client.

<Admonition type="tip">
  If you haven’t installed Endstone yet, see **[Getting Started](/docs/getting-started)** first.
</Admonition>

## Start the server

### If you installed with uv + pip

Open your project folder and activate the virtual environment, then start Endstone:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
uv run endstone
```

### If you're using Docker

Follow the instructions on the [Run with Docker](/docs/getting-started/installation/docker/) page.

## Basic configuration

Most base-game settings live in the Bedrock **`server.properties`** file.
After the first run, stop the server, edit the file, and start the server again.

### Quick Tweak

Typical options you may want to set:

```ini filename="server.properties"
server-name=Endstone Server
gamemode=survival
difficulty=normal
max-players=10
allow-cheats=false
allow-list=false
server-port=19132
server-portv6=19133
```

* **`server-name`**
The name shown to clients in the server list. Cosmetic only; doesn’t affect reachability.

* **`gamemode`** (`survival` | `creative` | `adventure`)
Default gamemode for new players. Existing players keep their current mode unless changed with commands.

* **`difficulty`** (`peaceful` | `easy` | `normal` | `hard`)
World difficulty. Can be changed at runtime with `/difficulty`, but set it here to persist.

* **`max-players`**
Hard cap on simultaneous connections. Higher numbers increase CPU/RAM and bandwidth needs.

* **`allow-cheats`** (`true`/`false`)
When **true**, the server allows cheats-like commands (like `/give`, `/tp`).
You still need elevated permissions (see [Permissions](/docs/user-guide/permissions/)).

* **`allow-list`** (`true`/`false`)
When **true**, only players listed in `allowlist.json` can join. Good for private servers.

* **`server-port` / `server-portv6`**
The UDP ports the server listens on. If you’re behind a router/firewall, you **must** open/forward these (UDP, not TCP).

### Make yourself an operator

From the server console, grant operator privileges to your player name (Gamertag):

```text
op <YourGamertag>
```

## Join from a Bedrock client

1. Make sure your **firewall allows UDP** on the Bedrock port (default **19132**).
2. If you’re on the **same LAN**, the server usually appears under the **Friends / LAN** tab. Otherwise:
3. On your device, go to **Play → Servers → Add Server** and enter:
   - **Server Address:** your PC's IP (or your public IP if port forwarded)
   - **Port:** `19132` (or whatever you set in `server-port`)
4. Save and **Join**.

<Admonition type="tip">
  Hosting over the internet? Don't forget to set up **port forwarding** on your router for UDP <b>19132</b> (and
  optionally <b>19133</b> for IPv6) to your server machine's local IP.
