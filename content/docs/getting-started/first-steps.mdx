# First Steps

This page helps you:
1. start Endstone for the first time,
2. make a few essential configuration changes, and
3. join from a Bedrock client.

<Admonition type="tip">
    If you haven’t installed Endstone yet, see **[Getting Started](/docs/getting-started)** first.
</Admonition>

## Start the server

### If you installed with uv + pip

Open your project folder and activate the virtual environment, then start Endstone:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
uv run endstone
```

### If you're using Docker

Follow the instructions on the [Run with Docker](/docs/getting-started/installation/docker/) page.

## Basic configuration

After the first run, the server will create a **`server.properties`** file in the server folder.
This file contains most settings related to the base gameplay.

The content of the file should look like this:

```ini filename="server.properties"
server-name=Endstone Server
gamemode=survival
force-gamemode=false
difficulty=easy
allow-cheats=true
max-players=10
online-mode=true
allow-list=false
server-port=19132
server-portv6=19133
enable-lan-visibility=true
view-distance=32
tick-distance=4
player-idle-timeout=30
max-threads=8
level-name=Bedrock level
level-seed=
```

<Admonition type="tip">
    To change the settings, first **stop** the server, edit the file, **save**, and start the server again.

There are some typical options you may want to set:


| Configuration                   | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `server-name`                   | The name shown to clients in the server list.                                                                                                                        |
| `gamemode`                      | Default gamemode for new players. Existing players keep their current mode unless changed with commands. Possible values are `survival`, `creative` and `adventure`. |
| `difficulty`                    | World difficulty. Can be changed at runtime with `/difficulty`, but set it here to persist. Possible values are `peaceful`, `easy`, `normal` and `hard`.             |
| `max-player`                    | Hard cap on simultaneous connections. Higher numbers increase CPU/RAM and bandwidth needs.                                                                           |
| `allow-cheats`                  | When **true**, the server allows cheats-like commands (like `/give`, `/tp`). You still need elevated permissions (see [Permissions](/docs/user-guide/permissions/)). |
| `allow-list`                    | When **true**, only players listed in `allowlist.json` can join. Good for private servers.                                                                           |
| `server-port` / `server-portv6` | The UDP ports the server listens on. If you’re behind a router/firewall, you **must** open/forward these (UDP, not TCP).                                             |


### Make yourself an operator

From the server console, grant operator privileges to your player name (Gamertag):

```text
op <YourGamertag>
```

## Join from a Bedrock client

1. Make sure your **firewall allows UDP** on the Bedrock port (default **19132**).
2. If you’re on the **same LAN**, the server usually appears under the **Friends / LAN** tab. Otherwise:
3. On your device, go to **Play → Servers → Add Server** and enter:
- **Server Address:** your PC's IP (or your public IP if port forwarded)
- **Port:** `19132` (or whatever you set in `server-port`)
4. Save and **Join**.

<Admonition type="tip">
    Hosting over the internet? Don't forget to set up **port forwarding** on your router for UDP <b>19132</b> (and
    optionally <b>19133</b> for IPv6) to your server machine's local IP.
