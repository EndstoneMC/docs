# Install on Linux

## System Requirements

Before starting the installation, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or later
- Debian 12 or later

<Admonition type="note">
  If your Linux distribution isn't Ubuntu 22.04 LTS+ or Debian 12+, **or** your CPU architecture isn't `x86_64`,
  consider running Endstone inside Docker instead. See **[Run with Docker](/docs/installation/docker)**.
</Admonition>

## Installation

<Steps>
  ### Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation)

  **Using the official install script (recommended):**

  ```bash copy
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ````

  If your system doesn't have `curl`, you can use `wget`:

  ```bash copy
  wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ````

  ### Create a virtual environment

  ```bash copy
  uv venv
  ```

  ### Activate the virtual environment

  ```bash copy
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

  ### Install Endstone

  ```bash copy
  uv pip install -U endstone
  ```
